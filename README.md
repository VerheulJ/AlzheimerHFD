QIIME2 Microbiome Analysis — V3–V4 16S Region
This repository contains key data and outputs from a multi-omics study investigating biological mechanisms associated with Alzheimer’s disease (AD)-like cerebral amyloidosis using a network biology approach. The analysis integrates fecal microbiome profiles and untargeted metabolomics (plasma and feces) from wild-type and McGill-Thy1-APP transgenic (Tg) rats under control and high-fat diets.

To identify network modules linking gut microbial taxa, discriminant metabolites, and protein interaction networks related to AD pathology. The ultimate goal is to reveal novel functional pathways and molecular intermediaries involved in the brain–gut axis modulation of cerebral amyloidosis.
